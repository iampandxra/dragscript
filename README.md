# dragscript
Currently in pre-release and testing phase! Use at your own risk.  
A human like auto/drag click script for Minecraft.  
AHK is bannable on some servers, check beforehand. Releases contain standalone .exe variants of the script for these instances.  

Download Autohotkey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/  

Download the latest release of dragscript here: https://github.com/break2003/dragscript/releases  

To start it just double click the script of your choice.  
To close it either press Alt+Esc or right click the AHK logo in the task bar and close it form there.  

v0.1 of dragscript targets ~50 CPS, but you can change the values in "rnd()" and behind "myVar," to change the range of random delay values in ms. Be careful with this as it can result in way too high CPS and get you banned that way. Also don't make them the same to keep the random aspect of it.  


Feel free to modify the script however you want but please mention the original creator, me (break2003).
